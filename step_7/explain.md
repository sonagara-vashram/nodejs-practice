# Understanding NPM (Node Package Manager) Installations ðŸš€

In this guide, we'll explore the concepts of **Global** and **Local** installations in NPM, along with how to **update** and **delete** packages effectively. ðŸ˜Š

---

## 1. NPM Installation Types

### Local Installation

- Local installations occur within the **current project directory**.
- This means that the packages are specifically tied to that project and are stored in the `node_modules/` folder.
- The packages are also listed in the `package.json` file, which keeps track of project dependencies.
- As a result, these packages are only accessible within that specific project.

### Global Installation

- Global installations allow packages to be installed **system-wide**, making them available from any directory in your system.
- This type of installation is useful for command-line tools that you want to use across multiple projects.
- Globally installed packages are stored in a designated global NPM folder (e.g., Linux/Mac: `/usr/local/lib`, Windows: `%APPDATA%\npm`).

---

## 2. Local Installation Example

- When you install a package locally, it becomes part of your project. This allows you to use the package directly within your code.
- However, the package is only accessible in the project where it is installed. If you try to use it in another project, it won't work.

---

## 3. Global Installation Example

- Installing a package globally makes it available for use in any project on your system.
- You can check all globally installed packages to see what tools and libraries you have available for use in any directory.

### Step 1: Install a Package Globally

```bash
npm install -g nodemon
```

- The -g flag indicates a global installation

### Step 2: Check Installed Global Packages

- Lists all globally installed packages

```bash
npm list -g --depth=0
```

---

## 4. Path Check for Packages

- You can check where global packages are installed using specific commands. This helps you understand where your system is storing these packages.
- Similarly, you can check the path for local packages to see where they are stored within your project's directory.

### Global Path Check

```bash
npm root -g
```

### Local Path Check

```bash
npm root
```

---

## 5. Updating Packages

- Updating local packages ensures that you have the latest version of the dependencies required for your project.
- For global packages, updating ensures that tools and libraries available system-wide are also up-to-date.

### Update a Local Package

```bash
npm update <package-name>
```

### Update a Global Package

```bash
npm update -g <package-name>
```

### Update All Global Packages

```bash
npm update -g
```

### Deleting (Uninstalling) Packages

```bash
npm uninstall <package-name>
```

### Uninstall a Global Package

```bash
npm uninstall -g <package-name>
```

### Checking Package Versions and Installing Specific Versions

```bash
npm list <package-name>
```

### Install a Specific Version of a Package

```bash
npm install <package-name>@<version>
```

## What is **`npm init`**?

**`npm init`** is a command used to set up a **Node.js project**. This command creates a **`package.json` file** that manages the project's **configuration and dependencies**.

- The **`package.json`** file is crucial as it stores:
  - Dependencies (packages that the project uses)
  - Scripts (custom commands)
  - Metadata (project name, version, description, etc.)

---

## **`npm init` Commands and Use Cases**

### 1. Basic **`npm init`** Command

```bash
npm init
```

This command prompts you with several questions, such as:
    - Package name: The name of your project
    - Version: Initial version (default: 1.0.0)
    - Description: A short description of the project
    - Entry point: The main file of the project (default: index.js)
    - Test command: Any test script command (if applicable)
    - Git repository: Link to GitHub or a Git repository
    - Keywords: Tags that describe the project
    - Author: The developer's name
    - License: The project's license (default: ISC)

```bash
package name: (my-project)
version: (1.0.0)
description: A sample Node.js project
entry point: (index.js)
test command: 
git repository: 
keywords: node, npm, sample
author: John Doe
license: (ISC)
```

### Quick Setup Using npm init -y

```bash
npm init -y
```

### Output

```json
{
  "name": "my-project",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC"
}
```

## Uses of the package.json File

### 1. Storing Project Metadata

The package.json file contains the project's name, version, description, author, etc. This information helps in identifying and managing the project.

### 2. Managing Dependencies

All npm packages you install for the project are added to the dependencies section in the package.json file. Example:

```json
"dependencies": {
  "express": "^4.17.1"
}
```

- This indicates that the project has Express version 4.17.1 or a newer version installed.

### 3. Defining Scripts

You can define custom scripts that automate tasks for the project. Example:

```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "node index.js",
  "test": "mocha"
}
```

- The npm start command will run the ```index.js``` file.
- The npm test command will execute the mocha testing framework.

### When to Use npm init

When creating a new Node.js project and setting up the ```package.json```.
For managing dependencies, as you can't track installed packages without ```package.json```.
To run custom scripts (e.g., build scripts, test scripts).
