# 🌟 Node.js Learning Journey

Welcome to my **Node.js Learning** repository! 🚀 This repository is where I'm documenting my progress as I dive deep into Node.js, starting from the basics and progressing toward more advanced topics. Each session includes both code examples and notes for clarity and easy understanding. 📚

## 📖 What You'll Find

- **📅 Step-wise Practice Code**: Each session is organized into folders for easy navigation.
- **🔍 Step-by-Step Learning**: Learn Node.js, from creating a simple server to working with advanced frameworks like Express.JS.
- **📝 Notes and Concepts**: Detailed explanations of key concepts learned in each session, with comments in code for better understanding.

## 🗂️ Folder Structure

- `step_1/` - Setting up a basic Node.js server using the HTTP module.
- `step_2/` - Understanding Node.js modules and working with NPM.
- `step_3/` - Building a simple server using the Express.js framework.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sonagara-vashram/nodejs-practice.git
   ```

### 2. Install Node.js

   If you haven't installed Node.js yet, you can download it from [here](https://nodejs.org). Make sure to install the latest stable version.

### 3. Navigate to any session folder

   For example, to access the code for **step_1**, use the following command:

   ```bash
   cd step_1

### 4. Run the Node.js application

   To start the application, use the following command:
   ```bash
   node app.js
   ```
