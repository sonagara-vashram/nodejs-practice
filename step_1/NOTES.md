# Day 1: Basics of Node.js Server

- Learned how to import the 'http' module.
- Created a simple HTTP server that responds with "Hello, World!".
- Server listens on port 3000.
- Important methods: `createServer`, `writeHead`, `write`, `end`, and `listen`.

## Steps to Run the Code

1. **Install Node.js**: Make sure Node.js is installed on your machine. You can download it from [here](https://nodejs.org).

2. **Navigate to the Directory**: In your terminal, navigate to the folder where you saved `app.js`.

    ```bash
    cd step_1
    ```

3. **Run the Server**: Use the following command to run the Node.js server:

    ```bash
    node app.js
    ```

4. **Check the Output**: Open your browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:3000/`. You should see the message "Hello World!" displayed.

That's it! Your basic Node.js server is up and running.
