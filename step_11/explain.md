# Explanation of the Code (Using `fs` and `os` Modules in Node.js)

---

## 1. **Importing Modules**  

- **`fs`**: Provides file system operations such as reading and writing files.  
- **`os`**: Provides information about the operating system, including the number of CPU cores.

---

### 2. **CPU Core Count**

- **`os.cpus()`** returns an array with details about each CPU core, such as model and speed.
- **`os.cpus().length`** gives the total number of cores, printed to the console. This information can be useful for understanding parallel processing capability.

### 3. **Synchronous File Write and Read (Blocking)**  

- **Blocking Operations**: The synchronous methods pause the entire program until the task finishes, which can slow down performance if the task is time-consuming.

  **Steps:**
  1. **`writeFileSync`**: Creates or overwrites the file `try.txt` with the content `"Hii there, "`.
  2. **`readFileSync`**: Reads the content of `contacts.txt`. The result is logged to the console.

- **Execution:**  
  - `"1"` is printed to the console.
  - After the content is read, it prints the file content and `"2"` sequentially.  
  This shows **synchronous operations block further code execution** until they complete.

---

### 4. **Asynchronous File Read (Non-Blocking)**

- **Non-Blocking Operations**: The program continues executing other code while the file read happens in the background, improving performance.

  **Steps:**
  1. **`readFile`**: Reads the content of `contacts.txt` asynchronously. When the reading completes, the callback function logs the result.
  2. The `"2"` is printed **immediately**, even before the file content is available, demonstrating non-blocking behavior.

### 5. **Thread Pool and Asynchronous Operations**

Node.js is **single-threaded by design**, meaning the main event loop runs on a single thread. However, it uses a **libuv-based thread pool** to handle expensive I/O operations (like reading files).  

- **Thread Pool:**  
  By default, Node.js provides a **thread pool of 4 threads**. Each time an I/O operation like `fs.readFile()` runs, it is delegated to the thread pool.  
  If more than 4 tasks are queued, they wait until a thread becomes available. This ensures that **CPU-intensive or I/O-bound tasks** do not block the main event loop.

- **Impact on Performance:**  
  Asynchronous I/O operations leverage the thread pool to prevent blocking the main thread, making the application **responsive and fast**, especially under heavy workloads.

### 6. **Summary of Execution Order**

- **Synchronous Execution:** Blocks the code, printing `"1"`, the file content, and `"2"` sequentially.  
- **Asynchronous Execution:** Prints `"2"` immediately, and the file content when the read operation completes.
