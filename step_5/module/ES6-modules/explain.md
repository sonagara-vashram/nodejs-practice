# ES6 Modules

**ES6 Modules** are used when you prefer the `import` and `export` syntax. These modules are part of modern JavaScript syntax and can be used in Node.js by setting `"type": "module"` in `package.json`.

## ES6 Syntax

- **`export`**: Used to export functions or variables.
- **`import`**: Used to import the exported functions/variables.

### ES6 Modules Example

- Using `export` and `import` provides a clean and organized syntax, making development more efficient.

## Why Use Custom Modules?

1. **Reusability**: Once written, the code can be reused across multiple files.
2. **Maintainability**: Breaking the code into modules makes it easier to manage and debug.
3. **Encapsulation**: Modules maintain their own independent scope.
4. **Modular Design**: Dividing the application into smaller parts makes the development process more streamlined.
