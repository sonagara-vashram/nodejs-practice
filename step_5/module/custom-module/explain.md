# Node.js Modules

In Node.js, **modules** are JavaScript files where functions, objects, or variables are exported to be used in other files. This approach makes the code reusable and maintainable.

## Custom Module

### What Are Custom Modules?

**Custom Modules** are modules that a developer writes themselves. These modules are a collection of reusable code that can be imported into other files using the `require()` function. Custom modules allow you to break your code into smaller, manageable parts, improving maintainability and reusability.

### Custom Module Example

- You define multiple functions or variables in one file, and then export them so they can be used in other files via `require()`.
